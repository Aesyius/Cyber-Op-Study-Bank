Data types in programming define the nature and characteristics of data that can be stored and manipulated in variables or memory locations. Examples of different data types include: ●Integer: Represents whole numbers without decimal points (e.g., 1, 100, -5). ●Float or Double: Represents decimal numbers with floating-point precision (e.g., 3.14, 2.5, -0.001). ●String: Represents a sequence of characters or text (e.g., "hello", "world", "123abc"). ●Boolean: Represents true or false values (e.g., true, false). ●Array: Represents a collection of elements of the same data type arranged in a sequential order.
