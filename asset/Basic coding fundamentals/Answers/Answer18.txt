Syntax errors in coding occur when the syntax or grammar rules of a programming language are violated, leading to compilation or parsing errors that prevent code execution. Runtime errors, also known as exceptions or runtime exceptions, occur during program execution when unexpected conditions, invalid operations, or exceptional situations occur, causing the program to terminate or behave unpredictably.
