A variable in programming is a symbolic name or identifier that represents a storage location in the computer's memory where data can be stored, retrieved, and manipulated. Variables are used to store values such as numbers, text, or objects during the execution of a program, allowing programmers to work with dynamic data and perform operations based on changing inputs or conditions.
