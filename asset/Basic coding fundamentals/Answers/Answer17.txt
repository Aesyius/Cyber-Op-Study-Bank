Debugging and troubleshooting code errors involve identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues or bugs in software programs. The process of debugging includes: ●Identifying the symptoms or manifestations of code errors, such as unexpected behaviors, crashes, or incorrect outputs. ●Analyzing the code logic, structure, and flow to pinpoint potential causes of errors, such as syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. ●Using debugging tools, IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), debuggers, logging mechanisms, or error messages to track, trace, and inspect code execution, variables, and program state. ●Applying debugging techniques, such as step-by-step execution, breakpoints, watch variables, variable inspection, and error handling strategies, to isolate, reproduce, and fix code issues systematically.
