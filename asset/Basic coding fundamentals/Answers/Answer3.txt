Comments in coding are non-executable annotations or text that programmers add to source code to provide explanations, documentation, or notes about the code's functionality, logic, purpose, or usage. Comments are important for enhancing code readability, aiding in code maintenance, facilitating collaboration among developers, and documenting code for future reference or troubleshooting.
