Scope in coding refers to the visibility, accessibility, and lifespan of variables, functions, or other identifiers within a program. There are typically two main types of scopes: ●Global Scope: Variables or identifiers defined outside of any function or block are accessible throughout the entire program. ●Local Scope: Variables or identifiers defined within a function or block are accessible only within that function or block and have a limited lifespan.
