The difference between an array and a list in coding depends on the programming language and data structure implementation. Generally: ●An array has a fixed size determined at declaration and can store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. ●A list is a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink in size during runtime, and it can store elements of different data types or objects in non-contiguous memory locations.
