Conditional statements like if-else and switch-case in coding are used to control program flow, make decisions, and execute different code paths based on specified conditions or logical expressions. If-else statements evaluate conditions and execute corresponding blocks of code based on true or false outcomes, while switch-case statements provide multiple alternative paths based on the value of a variable or expression.
