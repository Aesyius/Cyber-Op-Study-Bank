A statement in coding is a unit of code that performs a specific action or operation, such as assigning a value to a variable, calling a function, or looping through a sequence of instructions. An expression, on the other hand, is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. Statements are typically used to perform tasks, while expressions are used to calculate or derive values.
