TShark is a command-line packet capture and analysis tool that is part of the Wireshark network protocol analyzer suite. It is essentially the terminal-based version of Wireshark, offering similar capabilities for capturing, dissecting, and analyzing network traffic but without the graphical user interface (GUI).
