Common programming paradigms include: ●Procedural programming: Focuses on procedures or routines that perform tasks step by step in a linear manner. Examples include C and Pascal. ●Object-oriented programming (OOP): Organizes code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Examples include Java, C++, and Python. ●Functional programming: Emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions. Examples include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.
