Pass by value and pass by reference refer to different ways of passing arguments to functions: ●Pass by value makes a copy of the actual parameter's value, so changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original value outside the function. ●Pass by reference passes the memory address or reference of the actual parameter, allowing functions to modify the original value directly.
