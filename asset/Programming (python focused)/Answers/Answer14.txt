Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP principles include: ●Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into objects to hide implementation details and provide data abstraction. ●Inheritance: Allowing classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes (superclasses), promoting code reuse and hierarchy. ●Polymorphism: Allowing objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors based on their context or class hierarchy.
