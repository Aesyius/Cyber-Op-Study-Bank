Problem-solving and algorithm development in programming involve: ●Analyzing requirements and understanding the problem domain. ●Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems. ●Designing algorithms and data structures to solve each subproblem efficiently. ●Implementing and testing code to ensure correctness, functionality, and performance. ●Iteratively refining and optimizing code based on feedback and testing results. ●Documenting code, writing comments, and following coding conventions for readability and maintainability.
