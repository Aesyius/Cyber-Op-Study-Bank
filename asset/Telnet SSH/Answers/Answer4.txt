Security risks associated with using Telnet include: ●Lack of encryption: Telnet transmits data, including login credentials, in plain text, making it susceptible to interception and unauthorized access. ●Man-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers can intercept and manipulate Telnet sessions to capture sensitive information or perform malicious actions. ●Authentication vulnerabilities: Telnet's weak authentication mechanisms can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to systems.
