The benefits of using SSH over unsecured protocols like Telnet include: ●Encryption: SSH encrypts data, providing confidentiality and protection against eavesdropping. ●Authentication: SSH uses strong cryptographic methods for authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. ●Secure file transfer: SSH supports secure file transfer (SCP, SFTP) with encryption, ensuring data integrity during transfers.
