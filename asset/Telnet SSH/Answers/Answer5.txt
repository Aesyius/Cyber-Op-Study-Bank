Differences between Telnet and SSH include: ●Security: Telnet lacks encryption and authentication mechanisms, while SSH (Secure Shell) provides encrypted communication and secure authentication. ●Protocol: Telnet uses the Telnet protocol (port 23), while SSH uses the SSH protocol (port 22) for secure communication. ●Authentication: Telnet uses plain text authentication, whereas SSH uses strong cryptographic methods for authentication.
