Key features of SSH that enhance security compared to Telnet include: ●Encryption: SSH encrypts data transmitted between client and server, protecting it from eavesdropping and interception. ●Strong authentication: SSH uses public-key cryptography and digital signatures for authentication, enhancing security compared to Telnet's plain text authentication. ●Secure tunneling: SSH supports tunneling and port forwarding, allowing secure access to network services within encrypted sessions.
