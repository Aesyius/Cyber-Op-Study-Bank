Best practices for securing SSH configurations and connections include: ●Disable SSH protocol versions known to have security vulnerabilities (e.g., SSH-1). ●Use strong authentication methods such as public-key authentication and multi-factor authentication (MFA). ●Limit SSH access to authorized users and IP addresses using firewall rules and access controls. ●Regularly update SSH software and apply security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities. ●Monitor SSH logs for suspicious activity, failed login attempts, and unauthorized access.
