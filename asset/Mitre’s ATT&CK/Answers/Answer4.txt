Tactics in MITRE ATT&CK represent the adversaryâ€™s goals or objectives throughout an attack (e.g., Initial Access, Execution). Techniques are the specific methods used to achieve these goals (e.g., Phishing, PowerShell). Techniques can have multiple sub-techniques that describe variations or specific implementations of the main technique.
