The basic structure of an SQL query consists of clauses that specify the action to be performed. A typical SQL query includes the following components: ●SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve data from. ●FROM: Specifies the tables or views from which to retrieve data. ●WHERE: Filters data based on specified conditions. ●GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. ●HAVING: Filters grouped data based on specified conditions. ●ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns. ●LIMIT/OFFSET: Specifies the number of rows to retrieve and where to start from (often used for pagination).
