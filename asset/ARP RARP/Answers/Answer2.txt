The ARP process involves two main steps: ARP request and ARP reply. ●ARP Request: When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same local network, it sends an ARP request packet containing the IP address of the target device. ●ARP Reply: The device with the corresponding IP address sends an ARP reply packet containing its MAC address. This mapping information is then stored in the ARP cache or table.
