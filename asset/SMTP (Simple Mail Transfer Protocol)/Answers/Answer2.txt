The process of sending an email using SMTP involves several steps: a. The email client or server establishes a connection with the SMTP server of the sender's domain. b. The sender's SMTP server identifies itself to the recipient's SMTP server using the HELO or EHLO command. c. The sender's SMTP server sends the sender's email address using the MAIL FROM command. d. The recipient's SMTP server verifies the recipient's email address using the RCPT TO command. e. The email content is transmitted using the DATA command, including the message body, subject, and any attachments. f. The recipient's SMTP server acknowledges the successful receipt of the email. g. The SMTP connection is closed after the email transmission is completed.
