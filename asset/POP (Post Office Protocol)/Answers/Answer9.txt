Common POP-related issues and troubleshooting steps include: ●Login failures: Verify that the username and password are correct and that the POP server settings are configured properly in the email client. ●Email retrieval issues: Check for network connectivity issues, server availability, and ensure that the POP server settings (such as port number and SSL/TLS settings) are correct. ●Deleted emails not removed from the server: Ensure that the email client is configured to delete messages from the server after downloading them (if desired).
