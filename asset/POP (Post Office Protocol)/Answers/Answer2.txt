The process of retrieving emails using POP typically involves the following steps: a. The email client establishes a connection with the POP3 server running on the email server. b. The client authenticates with the server using the user's credentials (username and password). c. The client sends POP commands to the server to retrieve email messages, such as LIST (to list available messages) and RETR (to retrieve specific messages). d. The server responds with the requested email messages, which are then downloaded to the client's device. e. Optionally, the client can choose to delete emails from the server after downloading them using the DELE command.
