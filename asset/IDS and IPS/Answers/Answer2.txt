The main components of an IDS include sensors, analyzers, and consoles. Sensors are responsible for collecting data such as network packets or system logs. Analyzers process this data, applying detection algorithms and methods to identify potential threats. Consoles provide a centralized interface for managing and monitoring alerts generated by the IDS.
