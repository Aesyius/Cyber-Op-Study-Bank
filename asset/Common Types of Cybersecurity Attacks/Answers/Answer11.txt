Zero-day exploits refer to vulnerabilities or software flaws that are unknown to vendors or security experts, making them susceptible to exploitation by attackers before patches or fixes are available. Zero-day exploits are significant in cybersecurity as they can be used to launch targeted attacks, compromise systems, evade detection, or propagate malware without immediate mitigation measures in place.
