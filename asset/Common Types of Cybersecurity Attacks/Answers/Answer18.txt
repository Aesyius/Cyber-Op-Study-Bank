Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are sophisticated cyber attacks launched by well-funded, organized, or nation-state actors to infiltrate, surveil, and compromise targeted organizations or networks over extended periods. APTs use stealthy tactics, custom malware, zero-day exploits, and social engineering techniques to evade detection, establish persistence, and conduct espionage, intellectual property theft, or sabotage.
