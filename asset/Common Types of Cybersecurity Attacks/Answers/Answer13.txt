Brute force attacks involve systematically guessing or trying various combinations of passwords, credentials, or encryption keys to gain unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or resources. Attackers use automated tools or scripts to perform repetitive login attempts, exploiting weak or default passwords, dictionary words, or common patterns until successful authentication or system compromise occurs.
