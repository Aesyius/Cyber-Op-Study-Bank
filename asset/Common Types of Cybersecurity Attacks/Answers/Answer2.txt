Active cybersecurity attacks involve deliberate actions by attackers to breach or compromise systems, networks, or data. These attacks may include launching malware, exploiting vulnerabilities, conducting phishing campaigns, or performing denial-of-service attacks. Passive attacks, on the other hand, involve eavesdropping or monitoring network traffic to gather information without altering or affecting the target systems directly.
