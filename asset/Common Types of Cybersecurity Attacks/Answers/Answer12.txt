Botnet attacks involve networks of compromised computers (bots) controlled by attackers to carry out coordinated malicious activities, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam campaigns, credential stuffing, cryptocurrency mining, or click fraud. Botnets can exploit vulnerabilities, infect systems, and propagate malware across interconnected networks, posing risks to system integrity and network security.
