SQL injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications or databases by inserting malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters, allowing attackers to manipulate databases, extract data, bypass authentication, or execute unauthorized commands. SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, or unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in databases.
