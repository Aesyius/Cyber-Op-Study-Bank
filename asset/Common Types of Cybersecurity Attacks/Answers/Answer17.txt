Business email compromise (BEC) attacks impersonate legitimate email accounts or executives within organizations to deceive employees, customers, or partners into conducting fraudulent financial transactions or sharing sensitive information. BEC attacks rely on social engineering tactics, email spoofing, pretexting, or manipulation to trick victims into wire transfers, invoice fraud, or credential theft for financial gain.
