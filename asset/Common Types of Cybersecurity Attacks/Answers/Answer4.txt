A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber attack that aims to disrupt the availability of online services or websites by overwhelming targeted systems or networks with a flood of malicious traffic. DDoS attacks can lead to service downtime, slow response times, and loss of revenue for organizations, making it difficult for legitimate users to access or use affected resources.
