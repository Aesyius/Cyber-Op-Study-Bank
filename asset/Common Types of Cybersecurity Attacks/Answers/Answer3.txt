A phishing attack is a type of social engineering attack that involves sending deceptive emails, messages, or communications to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data. Phishing attacks often use spoofed sender addresses, urgent or alarming messages, and malicious links or attachments to lure victims into providing confidential information.
