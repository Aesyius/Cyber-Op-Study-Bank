The process of accessing emails using IMAP4 involves several steps: a. The email client establishes a connection with the IMAP server running on the email server. b. The client authenticates with the server using the user's credentials (username and password). c. The client sends IMAP commands to the server to perform actions such as listing folders, retrieving messages, managing folders, and marking messages as read or unread. d. The server responds to the client's commands and provides access to email messages stored on the server. e. The client can synchronize email actions (e.g., deletions, moves) between the server and the client's device.
