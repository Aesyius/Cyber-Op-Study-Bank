The stages of the Cyber Kill Chain model are as follows: ●Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and potential entry points. ●Weaponization: Developing or acquiring malicious tools or payloads to exploit identified vulnerabilities. ●Delivery: Delivering the malicious payload to the target system, often through methods like phishing emails or compromised websites. ●Exploitation: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system to gain unauthorized access. ●Installation: Establishing a foothold and ensuring persistence on the compromised system. ●Command and Control (C2): Setting up communication channels for remote control and coordination of the attack. ●Actions on Objectives: Achieving the attacker's ultimate goals, which could include data theft, disruption of services, or other malicious activities.
