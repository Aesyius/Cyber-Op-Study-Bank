Detection and response strategies based on the Cyber Kill Chain model involve implementing security controls and monitoring mechanisms at each stage of the attack lifecycle. This includes deploying intrusion detection systems (IDS), endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and threat intelligence feeds. By detecting indicators of compromise (IOCs) and anomalous behavior at different stages, organizations can respond quickly to mitigate threats and minimize impact.
