Wireshark is most effective for deep analysis of network traffic when a detailed understanding of protocols and packet contents is required. It excels in situations where visual representation and advanced filtering of network packets are needed, such as troubleshooting network issues, analyzing security incidents, or learning protocols in-depth. However, Wireshark may fall short in scenarios requiring continuous, large- scale monitoring, as it requires significant system resources and is not suitable for handling high volumes of traffic over long periods. Additionally, analyzing encrypted packets without proper decryption can limit its usefulness.
