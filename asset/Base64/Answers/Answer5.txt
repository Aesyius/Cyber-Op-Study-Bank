Common use cases for Base64 encoding include: ●Encoding binary data (such as images, audio, video files) for transmission over text-based protocols (e.g., email, HTTP, XML, JSON). ●Storing binary data in text-based formats (e.g., databases, configuration files) where binary representation is not supported. ●Representing cryptographic digests (e.g., hashes, signatures) in a human-readable format. ●Encoding data in URLs to avoid encoding conflicts and special character issues.
