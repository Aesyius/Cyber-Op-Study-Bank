Advantages of Base64 encoding include: ●Compatibility with text-based systems and protocols. ●Support for encoding binary data without loss of information. ●Ease of use and implementation across different programming languages. Disadvantages of Base64 encoding include: ●Increased data size due to encoding overhead (about 33% larger than the original binary data). ●Not suitable for all types of data (such as large binary files) due to size limitations and inefficiencies.
