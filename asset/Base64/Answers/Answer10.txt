Base64 encoding and decoding can be performed using programming languages such as Python, Java, or JavaScript by using built-in libraries or functions dedicated to Base64 operations. For example: ●In Python, the base64 module provides functions like b64encode() for encoding and b64decode() for decoding Base64 data. ●In Java, the java.util.Base64 class offers methods like getEncoder() and getDecoder() for Base64 operations. ●In JavaScript, the btoa() function can be used for encoding and atob() for decoding Base64 data.
