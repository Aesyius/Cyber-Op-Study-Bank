Zoning-related troubleshooting techniques for resolving connectivity issues may include: ●Verifying zoning configurations and ACLs to ensure proper device memberships and access permissions. ●Checking for conflicts or overlaps in zone definitions that may cause connectivity errors or disruptions. ●Monitoring zoning logs, fabric behavior, and traffic patterns to identify potential issues or misconfigurations. ●Testing connectivity between devices within and across zones to isolate and troubleshoot connectivity problems.
