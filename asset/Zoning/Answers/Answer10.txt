Zoning best practices for managing complex network environments include: ●Regularly reviewing and updating zoning configurations to reflect changes in network requirements or device connections. ●Implementing both hard and soft zoning where appropriate to balance security and flexibility. ●Documenting zoning policies, access control lists, and zone memberships for clarity and auditability. ●Testing zoning configurations in a controlled environment before deployment to production to ensure proper functionality and security.
