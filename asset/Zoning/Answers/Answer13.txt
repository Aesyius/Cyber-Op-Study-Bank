The process of configuring zoning in a network or storage environment involves: ●Identifying the devices, resources, or traffic that need to be grouped or isolated. ●Defining zoning policies based on access control requirements, application dependencies, or performance objectives. ●Assigning devices or resources to specific zones and configuring access control lists (ACLs) or zone sets accordingly. ●Testing the zoning configuration to verify proper functionality, connectivity, and security compliance.
