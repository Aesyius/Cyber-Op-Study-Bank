The main differences between zoning and partitioning in virtualized environments are: ●Zoning operates at the network or storage level, controlling access and communication between devices or resources. ●Partitioning, in virtualized environments, involves dividing physical resources such as CPU, memory, or storage into separate virtual partitions or instances, allowing for isolated execution environments.
