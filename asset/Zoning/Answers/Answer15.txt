Soft zoning and hard zoning are two approaches to zoning in Fibre Channel SANs: ●Soft Zoning: Allows devices to be grouped logically within a zone, but the enforcement of access control is done at the fabric level, providing more flexibility for changes and additions. ●Hard Zoning: Involves explicitly defining which devices can communicate with each other by creating strict ACLs based on WWN or port numbers, providing stricter access control.
