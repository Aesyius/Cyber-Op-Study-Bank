Different types of zoning commonly used in networking and storage include: ●Hard Zoning: Involves explicitly defining which devices can communicate with each other by creating strict access control lists (ACLs) based on WWN (World Wide Name) or MAC address. ●Soft Zoning: Uses more flexible policies where devices are grouped together logically, but the enforcement of access control is done at the fabric level, allowing for easier changes and additions to the zoning configuration.
