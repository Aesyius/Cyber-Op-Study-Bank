The three-way handshake process in TCP connection establishment involves three steps: a. The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate a connection. b. The server responds with a SYN- ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and sending its own SYN to synchronize. c. The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, confirming receipt of the server's SYN-ACK and completing the connection setup.
