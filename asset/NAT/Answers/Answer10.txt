The benefits of using NAT in network configurations include: ●Conservation of public IP addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address. ●Enhanced network security by hiding internal IP addresses and topology from external networks. ●Facilitation of IPv4 address space management in the transition to IPv6. ●Ability to map external services to internal devices using port forwarding. Limitations of NAT may include: ●Potential limitations in peer-to-peer communication and certain applications that rely on end-to- end connectivity. ●Complexity in managing NAT configurations for large-scale networks. ●Possible impact on network performance due to NAT processing overhead.
