The main types of NAT translations include: ●Source NAT (SNAT): Modifies the source IP address in outgoing packets to a public IP address. ●Destination NAT (DNAT): Modifies the destination IP address in incoming packets to a private IP address. ●Static NAT: One-to-one mapping of private IP addresses to public IP addresses. ●Dynamic NAT: Assigns public IP addresses dynamically from a pool to private IP addresses as needed. ●PAT (Port Address Translation) or NAT overload: Translates both IP addresses and port numbers to manage multiple connections using a single public IP address.
