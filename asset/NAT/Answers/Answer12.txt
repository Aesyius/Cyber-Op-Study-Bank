Common NAT-related issues may include: ●NAT timeouts: Sessions or translations expiring prematurely, leading to connectivity issues. ●NAT reflection: Challenges with accessing internal services from within the network using external IP addresses. ●NAT overload: Resource limitations on the NAT device due to a large number of concurrent translations. ●NAT traversal difficulties: Problems with establishing connections for certain protocols or applications across NAT boundaries.
