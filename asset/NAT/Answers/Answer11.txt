NAT can enhance network security by providing a level of obscurity for internal devices and preventing direct external access to internal IP addresses. It also conserves public IP address space, which is beneficial for network scalability and address allocation. However, NAT can also hinder certain applications or protocols that rely on direct peer-to-peer communication or end-to-end connectivity.
