NAT facilitates communication between private and public IP addresses by translating private IP addresses used within a local network (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) to a single public IP address when sending packets outside the network. This allows devices with private addresses to access the Internet or communicate with external networks where only public addresses are routable.
