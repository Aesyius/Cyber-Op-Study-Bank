NAT traversal techniques for VPN connections involve methods such as NAT traversal (NAT-T) protocols, IKE (Internet Key Exchange) keepalives, and encapsulation techniques like IPsec NAT traversal (NAT-T) or UDP encapsulation. These techniques help VPN clients and servers establish secure connections across NAT devices.
