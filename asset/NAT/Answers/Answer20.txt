The main differences between NAT and proxy servers in network communication are: ●NAT operates at the network layer (Layer 3) and translates IP addresses, whereas proxy servers operate at the application layer (Layer 7) and forward client requests on behalf of the client. ●NAT is transparent to clients and does not modify application data, while proxy servers may inspect, filter, or cache application data. ●NAT is primarily used for address translation and network connectivity, while proxy servers provide additional functionalities such as content filtering, access control, and caching for improved performance
