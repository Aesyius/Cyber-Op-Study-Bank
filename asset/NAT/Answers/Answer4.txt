IP masquerading, also known as Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT), is a form of NAT where not only the IP addresses but also the port numbers are translated. It enables multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address by assigning unique port numbers to each internal device, allowing incoming traffic to be correctly directed to the appropriate internal device.
