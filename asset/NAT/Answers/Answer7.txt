NAT handles port forwarding by mapping specific external port numbers on the public IP address to corresponding internal IP addresses and port numbers for internal services. NAT-PMP (NAT Port Mapping Protocol) and UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) are protocols that enable automatic configuration of port forwarding rules on NAT devices for applications and services within the network.
