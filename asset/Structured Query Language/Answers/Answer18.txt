A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are treated as a single unit. Its properties, known as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensure reliable processing: • Atomicity: All operations in a transaction succeed or fail as a whole. • Consistency: The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction. • Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other. • Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent, even in case of failure.
