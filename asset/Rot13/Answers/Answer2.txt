Encrypting: To encrypt text using ROT13, you replace each letter in the plaintext with the letter 13 positions ahead or behind in the alphabet. For example, 'A' becomes 'N,' 'B' becomes 'O,' and so on. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. Decrypting: Decryption with ROT13 involves applying the same process as encryption. Since ROT13 is a self-inverse cipher, applying it twice (encrypting the ciphertext again) yields the original plaintext.
