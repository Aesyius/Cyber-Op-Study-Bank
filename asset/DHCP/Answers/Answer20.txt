Best practices for DHCP configuration and management in a network environment include: ●Implementing DHCP redundancy with multiple DHCP servers for high availability. ●Configuring DHCP scopes and lease times based on network requirements and device usage patterns. ●Using DHCP reservations for critical devices to ensure consistent IP address assignments. ●Enabling DHCP security features like DHCP snooping and IP source guard to prevent unauthorized activities. ●Regularly monitoring DHCP server performance, address usage, and lease status for efficient network management.
