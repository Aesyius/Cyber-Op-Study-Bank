DHCP lease renewal occurs when a client requests to extend its IP address lease before the lease expiration. If the DHCP server approves the renewal, the client retains the same IP address and lease duration, maintaining continuous network connectivity. Lease expiration occurs when a client's lease duration ends, and the IP address is released back to the DHCP pool for reassignment.
