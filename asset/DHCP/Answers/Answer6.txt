The DHCP DORA process consists of the following steps: ●Discover: The DHCP client broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to find available DHCP servers on the network. ●Offer: DHCP servers respond with DHCP Offer messages, offering IP addresses and configuration settings to the client. ●Request: The client selects one DHCP Offer and sends a DHCP Request message to request the offered IP address. ●Acknowledge: The DHCP server confirms the IP address lease by sending a DHCP Acknowledge message to the client, finalizing the configuration.
