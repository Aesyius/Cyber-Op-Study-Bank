The main difference between FTP and HTTP is their primary purpose and mode of operation: ●FTP is designed specifically for file transfer, allowing users to upload and download files between a client and a server. ●HTTP, on the other hand, is a protocol used for web communication, primarily for accessing and retrieving web pages and resources (e.g., HTML documents, images, videos) from web servers.
