The main types of cloud deployment models are public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud. Public clouds offer shared infrastructure, which can increase security risks but is managed by the provider. Private clouds are dedicated to a single organization, offering more control but also requiring more responsibility for security. Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, allowing for flexibility but requiring careful management of security across environments. Multi-cloud involves using multiple cloud providers, which can improve redundancy but complicate security management.
