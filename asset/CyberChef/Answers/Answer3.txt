CyberChef is highly useful in scenarios where data transformation, encoding/decoding, or quick data analysis is needed, especially for formats such as Base64, hex, or binary data. Itâ€™s particularly effective for forensic analysis, data extraction, and quick manipulation of datasets. However, it may not be suitable for large-scale automation or continuous processing of data, as it is primarily a manual tool and lacks the scripting capabilities of more robust data-processing tools.
