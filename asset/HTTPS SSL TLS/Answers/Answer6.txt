The SSL/TLS handshake process in establishing a secure connection involves several steps: ●Client Hello: The client sends a message to the server requesting a secure connection and specifying supported cryptographic algorithms. ●Server Hello: The server responds with a message containing its digital certificate and chosen encryption parameters. ●Certificate Validation: The client validates the server's digital certificate, ensuring it is issued by a trusted CA and matches the requested domain. ●Key Exchange: Both client and server agree on a shared secret key for encryption and decryption. ●Secure Data Exchange: Encrypted communication begins using the shared secret key.
