Zeek (formerly Bro) is ideal for continuous network monitoring, especially in environments requiring high- level protocol analysis, anomaly detection, and logging of network activity over time. It works well in scenarios where generating actionable alerts or identifying suspicious activities is crucial, such as Security Operations Centers (SOC). However, it may be less effective in real-time packet analysis compared to Wireshark and might require considerable configuration and tuning. Zeek is not typically used for on-the-fly packet analysis, and its strength lies more in providing context-rich network data rather than in quick, detailed packet examination.
