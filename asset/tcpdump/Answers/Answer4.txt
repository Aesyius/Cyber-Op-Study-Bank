Common use cases for using tcpdump in network troubleshooting and security analysis include: ●Capturing and analyzing network traffic during troubleshooting to identify network issues, errors, or performance bottlenecks. ●Monitoring network communications for suspicious or malicious activity, such as network intrusions, malware infections, or unauthorized access attempts. ●Analyzing protocol-specific traffic patterns and behaviors to understand application-level interactions and diagnose protocol-related issues. ●Performing network forensics investigations by capturing and examining packet payloads, session data, and connection details. ●Testing and validating network configurations, firewall rules, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
