tcpdump is best suited for scenarios requiring a quick, command-line-based network packet capture and analysis. It is effective for capturing packets to identify basic network issues or monitoring lightweight traffic, especially on systems where a GUI is not available or practical. However, it is less practical for deep analysis of captured data compared to tools like Wireshark, due to its lack of graphical interface and more limited filtering capabilities. Analyzing complex data sets or interpreting packet content is more cumbersome with tcpdump.
