The main features and capabilities of tcpdump as a packet capture tool include: ●Capturing packets from specified network interfaces or reading from saved capture files. ●Filtering packets based on various criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols, ports, and packet content. ●Displaying captured packets in human-readable format (ASCII), hexadecimal format, or saving them in pcap format for later analysis. ●Analyzing network traffic patterns, protocol usage, and communication behaviors. ●Monitoring network performance, bandwidth utilization, and traffic anomalies. ●Integrating with other tools and scripts for automated network analysis workflows.
