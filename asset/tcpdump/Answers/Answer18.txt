Common pitfalls or issues to watch out for when using tcpdump in network analysis include: ●Capturing too much data and overwhelming system resources or storage capacity. ●Misconfiguring capture filters or options, leading to incomplete or inaccurate capture results. ●Failing to handle high-speed networks or large packet volumes efficiently, resulting in packet loss or missed events.
