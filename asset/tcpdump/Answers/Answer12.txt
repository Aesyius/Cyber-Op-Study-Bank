Advanced features in tcpdump for packet filtering, slicing, and reassembly include: ●Filtering packets based on complex criteria using logical operators (e.g., and, or, not). ●Slicing packets to capture only specific portions of packet data (e.g., headers, payloads). ●Reassembling fragmented packets for complete analysis of network flows and communications.
