Common variations of the Caesar Cipher include: ●ROT13 Cipher: This is a Caesar Cipher with a fixed key of 13, where each letter is shifted by 13 positions. It's often used for simple text obfuscation, although it provides minimal security. ●Caesar Box or Shift Cipher: This variation involves arranging the alphabet in a grid and shifting rows or columns to create a more complex encryption scheme.
