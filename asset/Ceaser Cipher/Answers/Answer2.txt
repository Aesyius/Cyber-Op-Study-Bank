Encrypting: To encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, you choose a fixed number (the key) representing the shift amount. Then, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by that amount. For example, with a key of 3, 'A' becomes 'D,' 'B' becomes 'E,' and so on. Decrypting: Decryption is the reverse process. You take the encrypted message and shift each letter back by the same amount as the key. If the key is 3, 'D' becomes 'A,' 'E' becomes 'B,' and so forth.
