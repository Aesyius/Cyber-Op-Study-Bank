Traditional antivirus software primarily relies on signature-based detection to identify known threats, while modern endpoint protection platforms (EPPs) use a combination of signature-based, behavioral analysis, and machine learning techniques to detect and respond to both known and unknown threats. EPPs provide more comprehensive protection, including advanced threat detection and response capabilities.
