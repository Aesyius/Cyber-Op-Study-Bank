The TCP/IP model is closely related to the OSI model, with both serving as conceptual frameworks for network communication. They share similarities in terms of layer functionality, such as the Application Layer providing user services, the Transport Layer managing end-to-end communication, and the Network Layer handling addressing and routing. However, the TCP/IP model is more commonly used and directly corresponds to the protocols and technologies of the Internet.
