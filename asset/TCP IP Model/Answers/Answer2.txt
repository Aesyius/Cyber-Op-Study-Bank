The four layers of the TCP/IP model and their functions are as follows: ●Application Layer: Responsible for providing network services to user applications. Functions include data formatting, encryption, and protocol translation. ●Transport Layer: Manages end-to-end communication and ensures data reliability. Common protocols at this layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). ●Internet Layer: Handles logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding across networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer. ●Network Access Layer: Deals with hardware addressing, such as MAC addresses, and provides access to the physical network medium.
