Some potential drawbacks or limitations of using UDP include: ●Lack of reliability mechanisms can result in lost or unordered packets. ●No congestion control can lead to network congestion issues in high-traffic situations. ●Applications must implement their error detection, retransmission, and reliability mechanisms if needed. ●UDP is not suitable for all types of data transfer, especially for critical or sensitive data requiring guaranteed delivery.
