Key differences between UDP and TCP include: ●TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery, while UDP offers faster, connectionless, and unreliable data transmission. ●TCP includes a three-way handshake for connection establishment and teardown, whereas UDP does not have a connection setup process. ●TCP handles congestion control and flow control, while UDP does not perform these functions. ●TCP segments are acknowledged and retransmitted if lost, while UDP does not have automatic retransmission mechanisms.
